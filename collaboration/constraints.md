# 🚧 Project Constraints

Our actions and decisions are guided by constraints, which define the
boundaries within which we perform. We can overcome obstacles, maintain
concentration, and collaborate as a team to accomplish our project goals if we
understand and adhere to them.

## ⚠️ External Constraints

### 🌐 Connectivity and Resources

- Poor internet connectivity and frequent power outages for some team members.🔌
- Some members lack access to a computer, making full participation challenging.💻

### 👨‍🏫 Mentorship and Feedback

- Limited access to mentors, making it difficult to receive timely feedback.🔄

### 📋 Project Requirements

- The project must be completed **by January 10th, 2025**.🗓️
- Each team member is responsible for completing **at least two coding challenges
and reviewing two challenges submitted by other members**.✅
- All solutions must be written in **Python**, utilizing Python libraries, and
tested with **pytest**.
- All team members are required to actively participate on **GitHub**.👩‍💻👨‍💻
- Every pull request must pass all CI checks before being merged.✅

### 🌱⏳ Personal Circumstances

- Team members have varying personal circumstances and schedules, impacting availability.
<!--
  constraints coming from the outside that your team has no control over:
  - project deadlines
  - number of unit tests required to pass a code review
  - technologies (sometimes a client will tell you what to use)
  - power or connectivity
  - ...
-->

## 🔐 Internal Constraints

### 🛠️ Involuntary Constraints

#### 🕒 Team Availability

- Differences in team members' availability due to time zones and other commitments.🌍
- The team primarily works asynchronously due to individual circumstances, with
**a minimum of one weekly meeting** to ensure progress and alignment.

#### 🔧🧠 Skill Gaps

- Limited technical expertise in **Git, GitHub**, and programming for some team members.
- Some team members have limited experience working on group projects.
<!--
  constraints that come from within your team, and you have no control over:
  - each of your individual skill levels
  - amount of time available to work on the project
-->

### 🎯 Voluntary Constraints

#### ✔️ Workflow and Standards

- A code review checklist will be used to maintain consistency and quality when
reviewing code.📋
- The team commits to avoiding overly complex challenges, focusing on tasks
directly aligned with deliverable requirements.🎯

#### 🕒 Scheduling and Deadlines

- An early deadline **of January 7th, 2025**, is suggested for completing team
deliverables.📅
- Each team member should allocate specific working hours within their schedule
to ensure milestones are delivered on time while maintaining productivity and well-being.⏱️

#### 📨 Communication

- Communication will primarily be asynchronous via **Slack** and **GitHub**,
with task tracking managed using GitHub issues and project boards.💬
- At least one weekly meeting will be held on **Google Meet**.📹

#### 🗂️ Naming Conventions

- Solution files should be named according to the challenge title, in lowercase
letters with words separated by underscores.📝  
**Example**  
Challenge Name: "Matrix Multiplication"  
  - **Solution File: matrix_multiplication.py**
- Test files should follow the same naming convention but must be prefixed with
test_.🔬  
**Example**  
Challenge Name: "Matrix Multiplication"  
  - **Test File: test_matrix_multiplication.py**
- Pull request titles must be clear, and a detailed description should
accompany each pull request to ensure that all team members can fully
understand its purpose and content.🔖
<!--
  constraints that your team decided on to help scope the project. they may include:
  - coding style & conventions
  - agree on a code review checklist for the project repository
  - the number of hours you want to spend working
  - only using the colors black and white
