## Test Structure

The test solutions are organized into the following directories:

- **Unit Tests**:
  - Located in the `/unit` directory.
  - **Purpose**: Validates individual functions or methods in isolation,
   ensuring they perform as expected.

### Naming Conventions

- **Test files**: Should follow the pattern `test_<module_name>.py`.
- **Test functions**: Should be named `test_<functionality>`, e.g., `test_login`.
  
### Writing Tests

- **Isolate Tests**: Each test should be independent and should not rely on
   shared states from other tests. This prevents flakiness.
  
- **Small Tests**: Focus on testing a specific functionality to make failure
   easier to diagnose.
  
- **Descriptive Test Names**: Test names should describe exactly what is being
   tested, for example, `test_user_login_with_valid_credentials`.

## Test Coverage

- **Target Coverage**: Aim for high test coverage, but prioritize testing the
   critical paths. Quality matters more than quantityâ€”avoid excessive or
  redundant tests.
  
- **Use Coverage Tools**: Regularly measure coverage using tools like
   `coverage.py` or `pytest-cov` to ensure all edge cases, normal cases, and
    error-handling scenarios are tested.

 **Review Results**: Check the output to see which tests passed or failed.
    Errors will include detailed stack traces for debugging.
